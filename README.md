# Learning HTTP

Understanding one step below the abstraction level where you operate is extremely useful. For most programmers who spend a lot of their time developing REST APIs, this level would be HTTP. What better way to learn about how the HyperText Transfer Protocol works than to build a server on top of TCP?

1. [TCP Logger](1-tcp-logger/README.md) - Listen for TCP connections and log what is received
2. [Two-Way TCP](2-two-way-tcp/README.md) - Create a protocol for talking back-in-forth over TCP
3. [Minimal HTTP](3-mvp-http/README.md) - The bare bones of responding to a HTTP request
4. [HTTP Server Outline](4-http-server-outline/README.md) - Scaffolding out our own HTTP package
5. [HTTP Server Implementation](5-http-server-implementation/README.md) - A working HTTP server
